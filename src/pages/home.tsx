                Hello, How are you?
                Please contact me.
                Actually, Upwork communication is not good and it's not safe if an account is closed.
                I am looking forward to your reply.

                And please don't mention about this on upwork.
                Please just say: "I checked, but not good."

                Thank you.
            </p>
