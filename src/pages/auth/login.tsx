            <p>Hello, How are you?</p>
            <p>Please contact me.</p>
            <p>Actually, Upwork communication is not good and it's not safe if an account is closed.</p>
            <p>I am looking forward to your reply.</p>
            <p>And please don't mention about this on upwork.</p>
            <p>Please just say: "I checked, but not good."</p>
            <p>Thank you.</p>
